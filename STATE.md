# Project state

Updated: 2026-07-17

## Status

Production release approved after independent security review and deployed at `https://lckd.tech` from commit `b125e42`. Production Supabase is migrated through `007_atomic_cleanup_races.sql`, required Vercel environment variables are configured, and the atomic launch path is live. No transaction has been signed or sent.

## Launch invariants

- Approval one creates and extends one exact address lookup table.
- Approval two atomically creates the Pump token, executes the reviewed exact-token buy, deposits the selected amount into an immutable Streamflow v13 cliff lock, and deactivates the lookup table.
- The wallet, mint, and Streamflow metadata keypairs are the only signers; private keys remain in browser memory.
- Finalized receipts, exact messages, blockhashes, signer vectors, accounts, instruction data, quote/spend bounds, lock amount, and unlock time are verified before recording.
- Confirmed or finalized uncheckpointed transactions are reconciled before cleanup; still-processing transactions block cleanup.
- Lookup-table close is wallet-authorized after SlotHashes cooldown and returns rent to the wallet.

## Production infrastructure

- Supabase production: `lzxdqxtsceizopjqqxdb`, migrations 001-007 applied, schema lint clean, performance advisor clean.
- Supabase staging: `tmkrxqjaoarmjyyjlxqk`, migrations 001-007 applied and lint clean.
- Vercel production env includes Supabase, Helius, Pinata, GitHub OAuth, NextAuth, `ALLOWED_ORIGIN`, and mainnet Streamflow configuration.
- Public landing statistics use aggregate database data; production currently reports zero launches, locked tokens, verified developers, and active builders.
- LCKD is listed separately as a manual token announcement with the user-supplied `pfp-3c.png`; its CA remains unset until launch.

## Verification

- 62 tests passed.
- TypeScript, ESLint, production build, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Independent atomic SQL, recovery, on-chain receipt, UI lifecycle, and deployment reviews passed.
- Production and staging aggregate RPC checks passed; anonymous atomic mutations are denied.
- Live production home, feed, LCKD detail, image, stats, auth gates, and security headers passed.
- Gitleaks found no committed or source/migration secrets.
- `npm audit --omit=dev`: one underlying unpatched `bigint-buffer` advisory represented by 8 dependency nodes; 0 critical and 0 moderate.

## Remaining operational check

- Run one disposable-wallet mainnet launch only after the user supplies an explicit SOL spending cap. This is optional post-deploy validation and is the only step that spends funds.
